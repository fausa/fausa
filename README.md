### Hi there 👋

<!--
**fausa/fausa** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my final project to complete my MS in Applied Data Science at USD
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create an end-to-end project that focuses on NLP for News curation
- 🤔 I’m looking to always learn more
- 💬 Ask me for unique or new ideas or solutions. 
- 📫 How to reach me: afaus@sandiego.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: I see the world through a different lens, which helps me problem solve when resources and time are limited. Real world has taught me we don't always have access to every tool or unlimited data
